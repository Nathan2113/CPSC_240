; Program information
;   Program name: Non-deterministic Random Numbers
;   Programming languages: One module in C, one module in C++, five modules in x86_64 assembly, and one module in bash
;   Date program began: 2024-Apr-8
;   Date of last update: 2024-Apr-11
;   Files in this program: main.c, sort.cpp, manager.asm, fill_random_array.asm, isnan.asm, show_array.asm, normalize_array.asm, r.sh
;   Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.
;   Status: Ready for release to customers

; Purpose
;   The program will create an array of size n, where n is input by the user, and between 1 and 100, and will create a random number
;     array, will normalize the array between 1.0 and 2.0, and then sort the array
