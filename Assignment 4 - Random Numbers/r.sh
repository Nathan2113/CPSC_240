# This program will generate 64-bit IEEE float numbers.                                                                      *

# Your numbers have been stored in an array. Here is that array.                                                             *

# The program will then take in user input for the size of the array that they want, if the user inputs a number greater     *

#                                                                                                                            *

# Once the user has input a valid array size, the program lets them know it is generating n random numbers, where n is the   *

# array, then it will normalize the array to be between the values 1.0 and 2.0, and will output the entire array again.      *
# After this second array output, the program will then sort the array (using C++ library functions) and will output the     *
# array one last time for the user, this time sorted from least to greatest                                                  *

# Program information
#   Program name: Non-deterministic Random Numbers
#   Programming languages: One module in C, one module in C++, five modules in x86_64 assembly, and one module in bash
#   Date program began: 2024-Apr-8
#   Date of last update: 2024-Apr-11
#   Files in this program: main.c, sort.cpp, manager.asm, fill_random_array.asm, isnan.asm, show_array.asm, normalize_array.asm, r.sh
#   Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.
#   Status: Ready for release to customers

# Purpose
#   The program will create an array of size n, where n is input by the user, and between 1 and 100, and will create a random number
#     array, will normalize the array between 1.0 and 2.0, and then sort the array
