#Program name: "Amazing Triangles" - This program will take first welcome the user the the program, and then output the     *
#system clock (tics) to the console. After this initial output for the user, the program will then prompt the user for their*
#full name, as well as their title (i.e. Dean, Vice-president, etc.). Once the user has entered their name and title, the   *
#program will tell them good morning, and that this program will take care of their triangles. After, the program will      *
#prompt the user for the sides of the triangle and its angle (this program solves SAS triangles). If the user inputs an     *
#invalid input (negative number, non-float number, or an input that is not a number such as 2.2.3+A), the program will      *
#let the user know that their input is invalid and will then prompt them for another input. After 3 valid inputs are        *
#entered (2 sides and 1 angle), the program will output a thank you message/confirmation of the user's inputted values.     *
#Now that the program has 3 valid inputs, it will use the formula for solving SAS triangles to find the third side, and     *
#will output said answer, as well as letting the user know that the length of the third side will be sent to the driver.    *
#Before this value is sent, the program will output the new system clock (tics). Once back in the driver, it will let the   *
#user know that it has received the value of the third side, and that a zero will be sent to the operating system.          *
