# After this initial message, the program will let the user know the directions of the program, which is as follows:         *
#                                                                                                                            *

# For the array enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.                                                  *

# The program will then take in user input, validating each input to make sure they are entering valid float numbers, and    *
# this process is done through the input_array.asm file, using isfloat.asm to validate their inputs. If the user inputs an   *
# invalid input, the program will let them know with the following message:                                                  *
#                                                                                                                            *

# Once the array has been fully entered, the program will output the entire array to the screen, which is done in the        *
# output_array.c file using the C language. Once the array has been output, the program will then compute the mean of the    *
# array using compute_mean.asm, and will then use the mean it found to compute the variance using compute_variance.cpp,      *
# which uses C++. Once the variance has been found, the program will output the variance to the screen for the user, and     *
# will then send the variance to main.c, where the program will let the user know that the variance will be kept for         *
# future use, and that a 0 will be sent to the operating system.                                                             *

# Program information
#   Program name: Arrays
#   Programming languages: Two modules in C, four modules in x86_64, one module in C++, and one module in bash
#   Date program began: 2024-Mar-3
#   Date of last update: 2024-Mar-7
#   Files in this program: main.c, manager.asm, r.sh, output_array.c, compute_mean.asm, compute_variance.cpp, input_array.asm, isfloat.asm
#   Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.
#   Status: Ready for release to customers

# Purpose
#   The program will take in an array of valid floating point numbers from the user, find the mean of the array, 
#        and find the variance, which it will output to the screen and send to main.c
