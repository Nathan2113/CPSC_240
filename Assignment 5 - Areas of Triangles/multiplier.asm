;/****************************************************************************************************************************
;Program name: "Areas of Triangles" - This program will prompt the user for the lengths of 2 sides of a triangle and the 
;size of the angle between them. All I/O in this program will be handled in pure assembly using syscalls. The conversions
;atof (string to float) and ftoa (float to string) both use built-in library functions. When computing the area of the 
;triangle, sin(x), where x is the angle, is used in the formula, and sin(x) is computed using a Taylor series, programmed in 
;x86_64. When the user has input 2 sides and the angle between, the program will convert the strings input by the user into
;floats, calculate the area, then convert the area into a string and output the area to the screen. Once the area has been  
;output to the screen, the program will then return the area to the driver function, written in C, and will confirm its 
;retrieval and convey a goobye message to the user.

;WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT VALIDATE USER INPUT
