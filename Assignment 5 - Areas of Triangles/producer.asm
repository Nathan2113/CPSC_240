;Program name: "Arrays" - This program will first welcome the user to the program, as well as outputting its developer.     *
;After this initial message, the program will let the user know the directions of the program, which is as follows:         *
;                                                                                                                           *
;"This program will manage your arrays of 64-bit floats                                                                     *
;For the array enter a sequence of 64-bit floats separated by white space.                                                  *
;After the last input press enter followed by Control+D:"                                                                   *
;                                                                                                                           *
;The program will then take in user input, validating each input to make sure they are entering valid float numbers, and    *
;this process is done through the input_array.asm file, using isfloat.asm to validate their inputs. If the user inputs an   *
;invalid input, the program will let them know with the following message:                                                  *
;                                                                                                                           *
;"The last input was invalid and not entered into the array.""                                                              *

;Once the array has been fully entered, the program will output the entire array to the screen, which is done in the        *
;output_array.c file using the C language. Once the array has been output, the program will then compute the mean of the    *
;array using compute_mean.asm, and will then use the mean it found to compute the variance using compute_variance.cpp,      *
;which uses C++. Once the variance has been found, the program will output the variance to the screen for the user, and     *
;will then send the variance to main.c, where the program will let the user know that the variance will be kept for         *
;future use, and that a 0 will be sent to the operating system.                                                             *
;                                                                                                                           *
