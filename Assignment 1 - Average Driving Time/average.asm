;Program name: "Driving Time". This program will take in the user's full name, their title, and the distances they have     *
;traveled from Fullerton -> Santa Ana, Santa Ana -> Long Beach, and Long Beach -> Fullerton, as well as their average       *
;speed for each trip. Once the program has the total distance traveled and the average speed of the entire trip, the        *
;program will calculate the total time of the trip, then the assembly file will send the average speed back to the driver
;function                                                                                                                   *

;  Testing: Alpha testing completed.  All functions are correct.
;  Status: Ready for release to customers
;
;Purpose
;  This program will take in total distance traveled and average speed and find the total time of the trip,
;  as well as sending the average speed of the entirety of the trip back to the driver
